# ChunChunMaru

ChunChunMaru (ちゅんちゅん丸/啾啾丸) is a Minecraft resource pack project.

WIP.

## Why?

Mojang updates its resource pack more frequently since a few years ago, and the author of resource pack also need to re-draw or rename their textures when updating. This is an entirely boring and useless work which consumpt a bunch of time. I don't want waste these time on changing resource pack into now format. So I create this project for my personal use.

## Principle

This project create some universal methods to dynamically create resource pack from vanilla resource pack. The only things need to do is resolve some naming issue and re-run this program to re-build the whole resource pack when Mojang updating its resource pack. This project is based on a programmer way of thinking, not artist way of thinking, due to I am a programmer. This project prefer using code to describe each texture modification, rather than a bunch of Photoshop files. So obviously this project may not be understanded the most of resource packer.

## Style

Additionally, this resource pack generator is served for my flavor. I am a redstone player, not builder or pvp player. So this project is focus on display redstone status and make easy on building redstone machines.

This resource pack has:

### Marked Block

* Slight border for common used blocks which also easily be confused when counting, such as cobblestone, bamboo block series and etc.
  - All tree block, including log, wood, planks, no matter stripped
  - All stone block, such as cobblestone.
* Significant border for all ore block.
  - Deepslate ore and nether ore also has border.
  - Ancient debries will have a animated shiny border.
  - Raw ore block (such as raw iron block crafted by 9 raw iron) also have border. Because they may appear in vein.

### Redstone

* More simple redstone wire and intensity shown.
* Redstone block status display.
  - Discern piston and sticky piston.
  - Repeater, comparator level and status.
  - Dispenser, observer status.
  - Door, trap door, button, pressure plate, lever.
* Leaf decay level.
* Music box tone and instrument.
* Cauldron, composter, beehive, bee nest level.

### Misc

* Massively modification of bedrock and netherrack to let them look not dizzy in world.
* Red border for infested blocks to let player know do not dig them.
* Border for sus sand.

## Dependencies

* Python (Python 10 suggested)
* PIL package.

## Usage
